## Overview: 
After doing some work for W. Avy they asked if we could help provide more information about Tempature Trends in Hawaii. They would like to have this information prior to opening their surf shop. W. Avy is looking for temperature data specifically of June and December in Ohau, HI. They would like to know if an Ice Cream Shop and Surf Shop business is sustainable year round.
